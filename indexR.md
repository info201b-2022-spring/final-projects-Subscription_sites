We are interested in this domain because it is something that each of us use in our daily lives among with millions of other people around the world. We believed it would be insightful to gather data about these platforms and share it with our peers. Netflix was the first streaming service of its kind to produce original movies and as it continues to grow and hold a dominant position in this field we were intrigued to analyse its data in greater detail.
We also chose to explore the available movies across other sites so we could discover the advantages and disadvantages of each site in comparison to one another.
